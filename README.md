Free and open source monero tracing tool

Also known as Snooper Testnet

I recently explored the tracability of monero and found this gem from Ciphertrace: https://news.bitcoin.com/ciphertrace-enhanced-monero-tracing-capabilities-governments/

It's a really neat visualizer of the monero blockchain with a way to trace it. And I wanted ot make something similar. So I did! Please help me improve it.
